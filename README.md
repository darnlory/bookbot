Book Bot is a Python program that analyzes a text file (such as a novel) and prints a statistical report on word and character usage. This project was built as part of the Boot.dev Python learning path and serves as a hands-on introduction to file I/O, string manipulation, and dictionary-based data analysis.

🔍 Features
- Reads and processes text files (e.g., .txt novels)

- Counts total word occurrences

- Tallies individual character frequencies (case-insensitive)

- Outputs a clean and readable report sorted by frequency

🎯 Learning Goals
- Practice reading from and writing to files in Python

- Work with dictionaries to store and analyze text data

- Improve understanding of string processing and basic algorithms

- Build a practical, beginner-friendly command-line tool

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python 3

- Tools: Git, Command Line
